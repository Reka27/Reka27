# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my page!

I am a self motivated, aspiring full stack devloper with 4 years of experience.
For me, programming is fun, like solving a puzzle.
It gives immense satisfaction when properly done.
And hence, I insist on the following statement.
**_'Everybody should learn to program a computer because it teaches you how to think â€“ Steve Jobs'_**
